    <h3> "How is OOP evident in the development of your portfolio website?" </h3>
    <p> Object Oriented Programming has been evident
      since I have used methods such as inheritance,
      polymorphism, and many more to know fully use my css's potential
      to be a better website that others could easily understand and grasp.
    I have also used OOP to grasp what can be edited and used for my stylesheet's elements. </p>
    <h3> "Based on your experience, how useful is OOP?" </h3>
    <p> OOP is very useful for individuals who uses various types of coding since this can be
      an easier way to implement elements such as Attributes and Methods rather than
      manually coding each individual, it can be derived and inherited from one another to avoid confusion
    and problems.</p>

      <h3>"How is OOP evident in the development of your portfolio website?" </h3>
      <p> Object Oriented Programming is evident in the development of my portfolio in the way 
			I tried to separate the content from its style. For example, instead of setting the image 
			dimensions in HTML, I rather opted to set it with CSS to reduce redundancy.
			In addition, OOP would be very much evident in the use of grids, especially organizing the gallery content. </p>
      <h3> "Based on your experience, how useful is OOP?" </h3>
      <p> With OOP, it became much more convenient to navigate and modify parts of the code that needed adjustments.
			It also paves way for more conciseness, organization, and orderliness, especially for websites or codes that would involve 
			numerous elements such as portfolios. </p>
