    <h3> "How is OOP evident in the development of your portfolio website?" </h3>
    <p> Object Oriented Programming has been evident
      since I have used methods such as inheritance,
      polymorphism, and many more to know fully use my css's potential
      to be a better website that others could easily understand and grasp.
    I have also used OOP to grasp what can be edited and used for my stylesheet's elements. </p>
    <h3> "Based on your experience, how useful is OOP?" </h3>
    <p> OOP is very useful for individuals who uses various types of coding since this can be
      an easier way to implement elements such as Attributes and Methods rather than
      manually coding each individual, it can be derived and inherited from one another to avoid confusion
    and problems.</p>
