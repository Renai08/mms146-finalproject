GitHub site: https://github.com/Renai08/mms146-finalproject

Renai - already polished yung htmls ko, I think oks na din yata css ko ? (sana), already put my refs sa ref.md, and made minimal adjustments sa homepage & q&a (pati sa css) :> 

#### will still need to connect homepage and q&a sa nav bar and we're pretty much good to go ig ^^

Airiel -- Edited the homepage and q&a to our fonts and added a diff picture for the homepage (feel free to use another pic too! :)) Also no worries and take your time! <3 Lastly, if you feel like this does not fit the 20 css components/objects, feel free to message me or add objects that you see fit! :D
