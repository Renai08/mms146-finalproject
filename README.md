Airiel -- Edited the homepage and q&a to our fonts and added a diff picture for the homepage (feel free to use another pic too! :)) Also no worries and take your time! <3 Lastly, if you feel like this does not fit the 20 css components/objects, feel free to message me or add objects that you see fit! :D
